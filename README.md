# Flower Classification with Machine Learning  

This project is a web application built with **React.js** and **Express.js**, utilizing **TensorFlow.js** to classify flowers based on uploaded images. The classification model is developed using **TensorFlow (Python)** and stored in **PostgreSQL** as the main database.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🚀 **Image Classification**: Predicts the type of flower from an uploaded image.  
- 🎨 **Modern Frontend**: Built with **React.js**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** for a fast and responsive UI.  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Model**: Uses **TensorFlow** for accurate classification.  
- 🗄️ **Backend API**: Powered by **Express.js** to handle communication between the frontend and ML model.  
- 📊 **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores classification history and flower data.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Express.js, TensorFlow.js, PostgreSQL  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow (Python)
